HAHAH I CAN'T FIGURE THIS OUT 
-
Idk what im doing wrong.... I can't catch the last value.

Guide coming soon ;-;

`fzero` is not catching one last value from my guess. I don't know why. 
I could write guide now but I don't want to write it until I finish it....

If you want to get started, here's some guidance. 

1. Start by making two functions given.
2. Now, you need to make a function that returns 0 if they intersect.
3. Before you use `fzero` you need to generate some guess numbers. You can have as many guesses as you want.
4. Try out each guess number with `fzero`. And store them into an array. 
5. Now you need to go though that array and delete any duplicates, and any numbers 
   that are within 0.00006 of each other.
6. By end, you should have 7 intersection points.
7. Plot them with X on the graph.

And you're done. I only have 6 values, and I don't know why. Anyways, if you wanna help me, 
that'd be kinda awesome.

% will start at 0.0, iteration 1.
firstPI = 0.0;
iteration1 = 1;

%% STEP 1
% Construct a while loop. We already know the condition.
% Think about the relationship between pi and firstPI.

%% Step 2
% Write inside the while loop. 
% We've covered the pattern, your job is to come up 
% with matlab code that does what we talked about.

%% generate new variables for the second part.
secondPI = 0; % be creative here. Should it start at 0?
iteration2 = 1;

%% Step 1 -- again (technically step 3 in my guide)
% For second step. 
% Remember, the condition is the same

%% Step 2 -- again (technically step 3 in my guide)
% Like we did before, identify the pattern.
% Write it down, and try to turn it into matlab code. 


%% Step 4 Print your answers
% The instruction is asking you to print 
% how many iteration it look to get to the value. 
% iteration 1 and 2 are the variables we need.

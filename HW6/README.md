# Fair warming for you all
Please ready this, this is a bit of message for you.

First thing first, **NO EPIDEMIC PROBLEM THIS WEEK!!!!!!**
That was brutal, but we have a week off from the epidemic problems.

Now, that being said...
#### This week's instruction is *extra* confusing
In this week's guide, I will actually hold your hand a bit more than I usually do.
I think(though, I haven't written anything at this point yet so idk how this is going to go but) 
I will add more detailed guide and code to get you started. 

But please do your own study, reading and research so that you're ready for those problems. 
I will continue to be available on Discord for everyone(when I'm not working. Yes I actually work
40 hours a week hahahahahah), but I am getting tired of very basic questions like "What are functions",
"how do I index this array?", "How do I call functions?" etc etc. 

I am hoping that this guide would help people get started and get good grades in this class. Look, I'm
struggling in ENGR 201, and ST 314, I get it, some classes are hard. But, this is not for you to cheat, 
and I'm not here to hold your hand all the way and telling you what to type on your screen. I am here to 
HELP you. 

I'm not trying to sound salty but hey, let's all do our part. Love talking everyone, but wrong to assume 
I will just tell you what to do to pass this class. As you probably know already(since I've talked to a 
lot of you already), I'm not a perfect student, or
any genius skills. I'm just s typical dude(just like 99% of people in this class...actually don't know 
male-female ratio lol) But do reach out for help, and I'll do my best to help you!

You'll be using matlab throughout your undergrad(and post grad if you're into that). It'll be useful,
and I promise, it's so so so worth learning.

Ok, I sound like your mom and I hate it. Anyways, please do your reading, learn stuff, and ask questions! 

Let's jump into the guide.

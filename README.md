## Disclaimer
I'm not your writing teacher, nor I don't care + I don't have time to go through and fix my 
mistakes. And I barely speak English(this is a lie) so leave me alone for any of writing mistake.
That said, if you see any issues with code or material, come to me ASAP and let me know, so I can 
fix my mistake. 
  

## Purpose
Guys, seriously, this class is HARD. Our adviser was not joking.... 

I wanted to share ways that I did those problems, showing you one of many ways to approach
the problems. Over the last couple of weeks, I've been getting tons of the same questions.
- I don't understand the question
- I don't know how to get started
- I don't know what I'm supposed to do here. and more.
- oh, and "MY CODE BROKE HELPPPP"

Beside the last one, which happens all the time, it is sometimes hard to understand 
what questions are asking, and what they're asking you do to. And instruction is hard 
to understand and follow too. So in here, I have broken down the question, and what it's asking,
and hopefully clearing things up by breaking it down to smaller pieces. 

## Rules
As a student, I cannot share my code with anyone -- unless I'm helping other people. 
Everything in here will be written in English, and ONLY code you'll see are ones from 
instructions, and code from previous weeks. You still have to do your own work, but I'm just 
here to hold your hand a bit and guide you to the right direction. That's all.

If you decided to follow and use this guide, **you have to put my name on the cover page**.
My name is Ryo Takei, and not Reeoh. Reeoh is how to pronouce my name, and my name is actually Ryo.
I'm not asking for credit for my work, but it's to protect you from getting into trouble.
To know more about what you can and can't do, refer to the Syllabus. I'm just a student,
don't ask me. (I'm only here for technical help). 

If you're flagged as cheating or anything sketchy, it is your responsibility, not me.

And if you also decided to use it, **understand what you're doing**. "I did that because
it said to" is NOT a good reason to do this problem. Whatever you type in, make sure 
you know what you're doing, and not just copying. Seek help if you don't understand! 

## Format
As you see, each homework will have a folder, with files and another instruction. You
are more than welcome to use my file as starter to get started or use your own. 

## For help
Use Discord, ask questions in the chat, or DM if you want. Ryo#7273. Or you can text me
at 971-254-7641 if you hate discord. Please don't use Snapchat or Instagram to get help with 
coding problem. I will ignore you. 

Make sure to seek help early so that you're not asking questions at 11:30pm on Wed. Bad
idea!

When you seek for help, make sure you put some effort to try to fix or understand first.
If you simply come to me without putting any effort first, I'm going to ignore you. Do 
not seek help without trying. That said, do not spend more than 30 minutes on one 
issues -- if you're stuck, just ask. Your friends are probably bored and not doing 
anything anyways.

Again, I am hoping that this will help. I'm not asking you to use it, but if you're stuck
and don't know where to begin, this is for you.

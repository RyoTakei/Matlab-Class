## Homework 7

We are almost done with this course... Tough times but we're really almost there.

This week's coding is not bad at all -- as long as you understand the instruction.
Go give it a shot and see if you can understand the instruction, otherwise, this guide 
might be helpful for you.

I caught myself just mumbling all the time so I've hidden some of my personal comments lol.

Anyways, not much to say this week, make sure to do the zybooks, and good luck on your midterm!
